# `scripts` #

This directory contains scripts for:
* simulating short and long reads using ART and SimLoRD (in `simulate`)
* correcting long reads using short reads with proovread, LoRDEC, Jabba and CoLoRMap with or without OEA (in `correct`)

They are designed so that parameters can be easily modified by the user for their own purposes.

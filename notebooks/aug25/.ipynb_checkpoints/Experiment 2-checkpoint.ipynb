    "PacBio long reads were simulated using SimLoRD. Two types of reads were simulated: CLR reads (e.g. maximum number of passes over each each read was set to 1) and CCS reads (e.g. maximum number of passes over each read was set to 40). For each type of read, datasets of long reads with coverages 10, 20, 50 and 75 were simulated.\n",

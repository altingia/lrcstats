Hybrid Correction Statistics (hcstats)

There are cases where the 3-way optimal alignments between the reference, uLR and cLR sequences contain two triples of the form
(X,-,-)(-,X,-). According to the scoring scheme, this is equivalent to the reduced triple of (X,X,-), so alignments containing 
the first case are equivalent to alignments containing the last case in terms of edit distance.
